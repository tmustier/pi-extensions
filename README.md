## Install (pi package manager)

```bash
pi install git:github.com/tmustier/pi-extensions
```

To enable only a subset, replace the package entry in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` with a filtered one:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/tmustier/pi-extensions",
      "extensions": ["files-widget/index.ts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quick Setup

If you keep a local clone, add extensions to your `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "~/pi-extensions/files-widget",
    "~/pi-extensions/tab-status/tab-status.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/arcade/spice-invaders.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/arcade/ping.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/arcade/picman.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/arcade/tetris.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/arcade/mario-not/mario-not.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/ralph-wiggum",
    "~/pi-extensions/agent-guidance/agent-guidance.ts",
    "~/pi-extensions/raw-paste",
    "~/pi-extensions/code-actions",
    "~/pi-extensions/usage-extension"
  ]
}
```

For agent-guidance, also run the setup script:

cd ~/pi-extensions/agent-guidance && ./setup.sh
```
